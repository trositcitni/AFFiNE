## Step 1: Visit the Mega.co.nz website
 
The first thing you need to do is to visit the [Mega.co.nz website](https://mega.nz/downloadapp/office) and click on the "Download App" button. This will take you to a page where you can choose the version of Microsoft Office 2013 that you want to download. You can choose between Professional Plus, Standard, Home and Business, Home and Student, or Office 365. For this example, we will choose Professional Plus.
 
## Step 2: Download the Microsoft Office 2013 installer
 
After you select the version of Microsoft Office 2013 that you want, you will see a page with a download link and a decryption key. You need to copy both of these items and paste them into a text file for later use. Then, click on the download link and save the file to your computer. The file name should be something like "Microsoft Office 2013 v15.0.5545.1000 Pro Plus VL (x86/x64) Multilingual April 2023.rar". The file size should be around 5.9 GB.
 
## Step 3: Extract the Microsoft Office 2013 installer
 
Once the download is complete, you need to extract the Microsoft Office 2013 installer from the rar file. You can use any software that can handle rar files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. To extract the file, right-click on it and choose "Extract here" or "Extract to folder". You will be asked to enter the decryption key that you copied earlier. Paste it into the box and click OK. This will create a folder with the same name as the rar file, containing several files and folders.
 
## Step 4: Run the Microsoft Office 2013 installer
 
To run the Microsoft Office 2013 installer, open the folder that you extracted and double-click on the file named "setup.exe". This will launch the installation wizard that will guide you through the process of installing Microsoft Office 2013 on your computer. You can choose the language, edition, components, and destination folder of your installation. You can also customize your installation by clicking on "Customize" and selecting or deselecting the features that you want or don't want.
